    "This tutorial explains how to create a Python multiline string. It can be handy when you have a very long string. You shouldn’t keep such text in a single line. It kills the readability of your code.In Python, you have different ways to specify a multiline string. You can have a string split across multiple lines by enclosing it in triple quotes. Alternatively, brackets can also be used to spread a string into different lines.Moreover, backslash works as a line continuation character in Python. You can use it to join text on separate lines and create a multiline string. Finally, there is string join() function in Python which is used to produce a string containing newlines.\nhis tutorial explains how to create a Python multiline string.
